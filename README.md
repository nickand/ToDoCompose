## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): for dependency injection.
  - [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?hl=es-419) <img align="right" width="130px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24237865/210227682-cbc03479-8625-4213-b907-4f15217f91ba.png"/>

- Architecture
  - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model)
  - Repository Pattern
- [Retrofit2 & OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Construct the REST APIs and paging network data.
- [Material-Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android): Material design components for building ripple animation, and CardView.
- [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide), [GlidePalette](https://github.com/florent37/GlidePalette): Loading images from network.

## Architecture
**ToDoApp** is based on the MVVM architecture and the Repository pattern, which follows the [Google's official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).

The overall architecture of **ToDoApp** is composed of two layers; the UI layer and the data layer. Each layer has dedicated components and they have each different responsibilities, as defined below:

**ToDoApp** was built with [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), so it would be a great sample to show how the architecture works in real-world projects.


### Architecture Overview

- Each layer follows [unidirectional event/data flow](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/ui-layer#udf); the UI layer emits user events to the data layer, and the data layer exposes data as a stream to other layers.
- The data layer is designed to work independently from other layers and must be pure, which means it doesn't have any dependencies on the other layers.

With this loosely coupled architecture, you can increase the reusability of components and scalability of your app.

### UI Layer

The UI layer consists of UI elements to configure screens that could interact with users and [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) that holds app states and restores data when configuration changes.
- UI elements observe the data flow, which is the most essential part of the MVVM architecture. 

### Data Layer

The data Layer consists of repositories, which include business logic, such as querying data from the local database. 

**ToDoApp** is an offline-first app is an app that is able to perform all, or a critical subset of its core functionality without access to the internet. 
So users don't need to be up-to-date on the network resources every time and it will decrease users' data consumption. For further information, you can check out [Build an offline-first app](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture/data-layer/offline-first).

## Modularization

**ToDoApp** adopted modularization strategies below:

- **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time.
- **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time.
- **Strict visibility control**: Modules restrict to expose dedicated components and access to other layers, so it prevents they're being used outside the module
- **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules.
